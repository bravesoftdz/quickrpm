this was an attempt to make an utility similar to gentoo's quickpkg for rpm based distros. in case you have an rpm already installed, but you've lost the rpm installer, the utility can help you to build a new rpm from the existing installation.
i have no idea, if i have finished it, or in which stage is it. i'll check later.
